<h1>Sprint 2 </h1>

<p>My aim for Sprint 2 is to have two options of shapes to be able to draw from. Therefore I have chosen to have the rectangle
    from the previous sprint and to make a new shape of ellipse. Also with the use of buttons, the user will be able 
to switch between the two shapes </p>

    Need to change one of the colours from the colArray as the pink has been repeated. </p>

<h2> Testing </h2>
<p>This test shows how the circle is only able to be drawn on the canvas where the boundary is set. However there is 
    no default colour being set, therefroe this will be something I do further on in the sprints. </p>

<h5 class = "reflection"> Reflection </h5>
<p> In this sprint, there were a few issues that did arise at first. I had previously made an ellipse in the secound sprint,
    which meant that the circle would be a bit easier as the ellipse and circle had quite similar 
    code. However I found it quite difficult to figure out the radius. With some help from the teacher i realsied that 
    it wsa best to work out the radius from the guided rectangle that we make. After solving this issue, it made a lot
    of sense and helped me to figure out other code in the future. With a few small errors, I had learnt how to tackle them 
    and work them out myself which was very beneficial.

<!---- Sprint Five starts down here--> 

<h1> Sprint 5 </h1>

<p>For Sprint 5, my aim is to include undo and reset buttons so that the user is able to undo and/or clear their drawing 
     </p>

<h2>My Trello plan </h2>

<h2> Testing </h2>
<p>This testing shows how the undo and reset buttons work. They do not work if you click on the canvas which 
    is what is expected. However with the circle the guided shape as a small circle with a rectngle around it - this needs 
to be changed to just a guided rectangle. It can also be seen with the testing that the ellipse doesn't have a 
guided shape or outline when the user is drawing it which will be changed further on. </p>

<source src="Sprint 5/sprint5.mp4" type="video/mp4">

</div>
<h5 class = "reflection">Reflection</h5>
<p> This sprint was quite short and straightforward, howevver there were a few errors that arose. Firstly 
    the shape would only undo or reset if the mouse/user clicked in the boundary/canvas. After some time, I had realised 
    with a bit of help that my undo and reset button were in the condition of  - if in rect bound and mouse is down. 
    this measn it would only work if the mouse was down in the boundary. 
</p>

<!---- Sprint Six starts down here--> 

<h1> Sprint 6 </h1>

<p>For Sprint 6, I am wanting to achieve to draw a line, which can have different width sizes - this will be done further on
    the sprints  </p>
<h4>Link to Sprint 6 - <a href = "Sprint 6/internal.html">Sprint 6</a></h4>


<h2>My Trello plan </h2>
<div><img class="imgSizer" src="Sprint 6/trello6.JPG"></div>


<h2> Testing </h2>
<p>This test shows how the line does not go out of boundary and the default colour has been set to black for all 
    shapes which makes it more user - friendly.  </p>
<div class="vid_div"><video width="600"  controls>
<source src="Sprint 6/sprint6.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>
</div>
<h5 class = "reflection">Reflection</h5>
<p> In this sprint, there were not many errors that popped up. But I had figured that it was easier if there was a
    default colour put in so that users wouldn't have to change thee colour before using it. i also had a vision that it 
    would be interesting for users to have different line sizes, therefore in the next few sprints, that was something I 
    wanted to achieve. 
</p>

<!---- Sprint Seven starts down here--> 

<h1> Sprint 7 </h1>

<p>For Sprint 7, my aim is to create a brush that can have different sizes. </p>
<h4>Link to Sprint 7- <a href = "Sprint 7/internal.html">Sprint 7</a></h4>


<h2>My Trello plan </h2>
<div><img class="imgSizer" src="Sprint 7/trello7.JPG"></div>


<h2> Testing </h2>
<p>this test shows that the all the brush sizes work. However there are a few fixible things that have been 
    fixed in the last sprint and some that aren't fixible. The fixible was the brush going out of the bounds and also 
that the sizes large and extra large were uite similar which can be changed. The non- fixible thing was that if 
the user tries to move the brush to quickly it breaks up which is essentially because the computer is unable to pick up 
the speed  </p>

<source src="Sprint 7/sprint7.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>
</div>
<h5 class = "reflection">Reflection</h5>
<p>In this sprint, I had made a brush. However there were a few errors that occured. Some of these were fixed later on
    in the sprints. One of them was that it wasn't drawing on the canvas, however i fixed that by getting my variables right
which made a lot more sense. But the brush would always go out of bounds which I ended up solving in my last sprint. </p>

<!---- Sprint Eight starts down here--> 

<h1> Sprint 8 </h1>

<p>For Sprint 8, my aim is to create different line widths for the line as mentioned above. </p>
<h4>Link to Sprint 8- <a href = "Sprint 8/internal.html">Sprint 8</a></h4>


<h2>My Trello plan </h2>
<div><img class="imgSizer" src="Sprint 8/trello8.JPG"></div>

<h2> Testing </h2>
<p>this test shows that for the line width there is a default colour being set which is black and there is also a default
    size. For the future, I might reduce the sizes to three - S,M,L to make it simpiler. The line is working perfectly.</p>
<div class="vid_div"><video width="600"  controls>
<source src="Sprint 8/sprint8.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>
</div>
<h5 class = reflection>Reflection</h5>
<p> in this sprint, I tried to make different line sizes as discussed above. I had figured oout a few options to do this 
    which was by creating a whole new button file for the line width. However the thought of joining the brush and line sizes together 
    made more sense. The same process followed this but instead of having the radius it was the width. I followed the smae process 
    as making the different brush sizes and was successful at the end of it.  
</p>
<!---- Sprint Nine starts down here--> 

<h1> Sprint 9 </h1>

<p> For Sprint 9, my is to create another shape so that the user has different varities to choose from. Therefore in this 
    sprint, I will create a square</p>
<h4>Link to Sprint 9- <a href = "Sprint 9/internal.html">Sprint 9</a></h4>


<h2>My Trello plan </h2>
<div><img class="imgSizer" src="Sprint 9/trello9.JPG"></div>


<h2> Testing </h2>
<p>This test shows that the sqare has a default colour of black, which is expected. Howeever the square that is drawn seems 
    to go out of bounds at some point which can be fixed later on.
</p>
<div class="vid_div"><video width="600"  controls>
<source src="Sprint 9/sprint9.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>
</div>
<h5 class = "reflection">Reflection</h5>
<p>this sprint included drawing a square. I found this quite hard even though I would have thought it was quite similar to 
    the coding to the rectangle. When I finally got the code for the square, there were issues that aorse from it. 
    Firstly - the square would go out of bounds (which eventualy got fixed at the last sprint),  the square would'nt draw
    where the user wants it to which created an issue. However after getting the variables right, it started to work 
</p>
<!---- Sprint Ten starts down here--> 

<h1> Sprint 10 </h1>

<p>For Sprint 10, I want to try something different and use animation, therefore my aim is to create a rotating rectangle </p>
<h4>Link to Sprint 10- <a href = "Sprint 10/internal.html">Sprint 10</a></h4>


<h2>My Trello plan </h2>
<div><img class="imgSizer" src="Sprint 10/trello10.JPG"></div>


<h2> Testing </h2>
<p>this test is for the testing of the rotating rect and also everything else as it is my last sprint. 
    As you can tell the brush isn't going out of bounds and that is the same with the square. the rotating rectangle 
also doesn't go out of the boundary. I have also kept the line widths to S,M,L and the brush sizes for large and 
extra large have gone larger s that it is easier to tell between the two.  </p>
<div class="vid_div"><video width="600"  controls>
<source src="Sprint 10/sprint10.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>
</div>
<h5 class = "reflection">Reflection</h5>
<p> For my last sprint I created a rotating rect. The same issue arose as the brush and square whre it would go out of bounds.
    Therefore, clip() was added where it essentially clips of the part of the shape or brush stroke that is going out 
    bounds. This solved all the issues for that which meant that it all worked perfetly well. 
</p>
<h1>Relevant Implications </h1>

<h5>Future Proofing </h5>
<p class = "end">  Program is designed so new features can be added easily and old ones removed
<br> Adressed   - in the way the program has been designed. Project elements(
    colours, buttons, shapes) have all been programmed as objects,  means each object is a self-contained, modular piece of code, 
    that takes a defined set of parameters to work,(may take basic mouse data and color), all objects are built to a similar 
    structure and compulsory contain an update function which means they can appear on the interface using the update call, 
    management of most of the objects happens in a central place (control object), the idea is that an experienced programmer 
    would easily be able to remove elements or add new features, comments are also precise and informative.  
 <p>

<p class = "end"> Functionality - does the program work well? Is it free of bugs? loads quickly? works on different browsers? 
        have we addressed this? Program is pure javascript, has no graphics, so loads very quicky, 
        I have tested by using a live web server to store my versions and have observed loading performance <br>
        - To ensure the program works well I have systematically tested it, tested user interactions
         (position of clicking and direction of dragging. This has included careful checks around boundaries. 
         The use of the Math.abs function was discovered after testing failures drawing circular shapes(because 
         these objects where being given negative radius values).<br>
         Any new components were tested prior to being added to the main program. At various stages in sprints, 
         console logging was used to analyze boundary test functions, and locate problems when bugs appeared.
    </p>

<h5>Examples of Trialing and Making Decisions</h5>
<p class ="end"> Can you find examples of exploring different options and making a decision about which is the best solution?
        <br> - Trying to figure out doing buttons for different line widths so that the user is able to choose what size the line will be. 
        <br> - Trying to created the guided shape(each shape has their own guided shape)
        <br> - what the best way was to do the colour buttons (which was by loops)

</p>

<p class = "end">Effectively using information from testing and trialing to 
    improve the functionaility of the outcome.
    <br> - Interface design trialing color themes 
    <br> - Different line width sizes 
    <br> - Changing the transparency of the colors - look too similar 
    <br> - figuring out sizing for the brush sizes(don't want them too similar)
    <br> - changing the colour scheme (which ones go together)
    
    </p>

<p class = "end">How did your working process(planning, testing, trialing)lead to the development of a 
    high-quality digital outcome? 
    <br> How was the Agile process helpful?
    <br>- Allowed planning and development to happen together
    <br>- Created repeated cycles of plan - develop - test.
    <br> - after two or three sprints I got a much clearer idea 
            of what I could achieve and my aims became much more focused and realistic
